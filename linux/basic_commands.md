# Basic Linux Commands.

```sh
# This is a comment, it’s ignored by the program
# Can be useful for writing notes

ls   # list directories (good for
     # seeing files and folders in a directory).
     # Very useful after entering "cd"
     # Example: “cd my_dir” -> "ls"
     # Alternatively: "cd my_dir" -> "l"

cat  # prints the contents of text files verbatim
     # Example: "cat my_file.txt"

cd   # changes directories
     # Example: "cd my_dir"

cd ~ # goes back to home directory

sudo # executes commands with admin privileges

root # gives root access to pc

grep # is an advanced filter

chmod # allows you to change it if you want to 
      # run/write/execute commands.

# **************************************************************#	 

# important symbols that can be paired

| # pipe can be paired with grep

~ # paired with cd will send you back to the origin

# <tab> -> will fill in what you're typing
# example typing in sudo as su, then hitting tab will fill in 
# rest. same with cd Documents, if you type `cd {doc}` then hit 
# <tab> it will fill in the rest
```
